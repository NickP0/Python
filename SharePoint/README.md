# SharePoint Storage Management
- the *.py* files in here are specifically for accessing MS SharePoint and deleting old file version history.
- encountered a problem at my previous job where data was being updated and uploaded to SharePoint via OneDrive.
  -  we ended up using 1TB of storage in a few weeks and had to get rid of the old versions of the files.
