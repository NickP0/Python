# SharePoint Storage Management
- the *.py* files in here are specifically for accessing MS SharePoint and deleting old file version history.
- encountered an issue in SharePoint due to excessive storage consumption caused by the accumulation of old file versions. This issue arose when data was being frequently updated and uploaded to SharePoint via OneDrive.
- to address the problem, I wrote `Sharepoint-Del-Vers-Hist.py` to automate the process of deleting old file versions in Sharepoint.
- please make sure that you have the necessary permissions and authentication credentials to access your SharePoint environment.
