# Texas Hold Em
- This project was part of an Introduction to Python course
- The 'game' is definitely not complete.
  - can run `main.py` to emulate two players playing a hand of Texas Hold Em<br>
    - there are problems with logic: if both players have the same hand e.g. a pair, winner will not be chosen based on who has the 'best' pair.
    - needs wager logic
    - I'm sure there's plenty of things that need to be added.<br>

*I might come back to finish this in the future.. (I have no interest in Poker!)*
